# ANN

Simple ANN (re)written from scratch. In development. Largely built according to [Make Your Own Neural Net][1] book, but aims to extend that in some aspects (e.g. number of layers).

This is the second incarnation of this project. The original code can be found in the `old/` directory and peaked at 97.7% accuracy on MNIST using a single hidden layer with 200 neurons and 10 epochs of training.

### Usage

The rewrite is not functional as of now. The original code works, however. Simply compile DigitRecognizer.java and run it.
